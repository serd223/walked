# walkEd
Terminal file manager inspired by [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [Dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) as a concept. walkEd doesn't try to recreate Dired entirely. I was just inspired by the general style of Dired from what I've seen (never used it).
